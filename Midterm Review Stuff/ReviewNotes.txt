* Write about a number of sensors, and write about the flow of the whole system, sensors, brains, actuators, etc. 
	A question about sensors could be like: "in your project, you're using such and such sensors, what is the purpose of it, what are some of the sources of innacuracy, etc."
* Write about Noise, and Signal conditioning, and how to handle the various amounts of error, as well as how to filter out bad data. 
	how to filter camera noise, or how to handle that. 
* Processors: 
	Taxonomy for the processors, single core, multi-core, 
	Instruction sets, 
	scheduling, etc. 
*Multithreading: 
	Two different types of multithreading. 
Voltage is always a battle of power vs. performance.

cache: 
	Look at Cache impact on system performance slide for equations of below graph: 
	might ask us to draw a graph, asking for the cache performance vs. size
He will not ask about the super advanced kind of memory (RAMBUS, etc)

Scheduling things to consider: 
	*Can the task be preempted
	*Can a new task start?
	*Is the task periodic
	* Does the task have precedence (priority, etc.)
